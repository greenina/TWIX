## POV

        - **Newcomers of eco-friendly product consumption**

        - **be motivated steadily in eco-friendly consumption**

        -makes the **“desire of contributing to environment” overcome the “desire of personal gain(price, function, etc)”** in purchasing product which helps users **act at will to protect the environment**.

## Persona

We developed a persona with details(profile, demography, needs, etc). As a process, we first collected a wide range of ideas about persona's detail through brainstorming, and then decided on the final detail through review and voting.

2. Brainstorm further by getting inspired from others’ ideas
3. Group ideas with similar themes, and make new HMW with a higher sense
4. Each member vote for 3 attractive HWMs with the reason for choosing.

All of the HMWs can be concerned as starting with "How might we ..."

    1. The color of the circle is displayed under the product price depending on the amount of chemicals from the three stages of the production process/product delivery process/product disposal process.
    2. Each product tags parts that help the environment so that users can filter the tags themselves.

### Peer reviews

**I like …**

- Suggested solutions and specific reasons of HMWs and solutions
    - could understand easily
    - how they touched user’s emotion by virtual companion
- Contents
    - describing with brands info
    - the POV is related to eco-friendly products since they’re saving the nature
    - deviding environmental infos into several cartegories
    - detail and quality of storyboards

**I wish ...**

- Descriptions
    - description about how ‘needs to be steadily advertised(?) by eco-friendly product’ is the needs of the new-comers to eco-friendly products! Or was it the problem status? →[[1]](#fb-one)
- Wishes in a presentation
    - more explanation about the term you use in your presentation. I does not directly what it means getting interact emotionally and other terms
    - reminder of HMW questions while introducing the solutions
    - indicator of which storyboard explain which solution
- Opinions about setting product's contribution
    - The effects of each product differ by amount, material, etc.

**What if ...**

This region is empty.

**Others**

- I’m curious why you chose those brands to explain persona! What did you intended for those information? → [[3]](#fb-three)
- Is the green points you mentioned in 3rd story board will be enough motivation? Maybe appealing that they use eco-friendly products may be good to advertise their cafe. → [[2]](#fb-two)
- I’m wondering how to evaluate environmental contribution
- I wonder what does 'interacting emotionally with eco-friendly products' means in HMW.
- I wonder if giving points on buying eco friendly products will cause overconsumption, which is bad for the environment. → [[2]](#fb-two)
- How will the green points divided when users purchase in group? → [[2]](#fb-two)

### Feedback during Session Time

- Clear justification of needs → [[1]](#fb-one)
- Storyboard should not be UI-driven but scenario-driven → [[4]](#fb-four)
- Not like in the PPT, the storyboard and description should exist together, not separate → [[4]](#fb-four)

### Summarize the reflection of feedback

- Provision of more descriptions
    - <a name="fb-one"></a>[1] justification of needs :

        Our target users have the will to protect the environment, but they sometimes find their desire of personal gain(price, functionality, etc) suppressing their desire of contributing to environment, and eventually fail to purchase eco-friendly product.
        Therefore, users want to get motivated steadily in eco-friendly consumption for the desire of contributing to environment to overcome the desire of personal gain.
        We actually got this point not by our own assumption, but by the mentioning of our interviewee.

    - <a name-"fb-two"></a>[2] about green points

        For reasons such as the UI of the program and its exact function are not clearly determined, we inserted the concept of a green point on the third storyboard. This is expressed as an example of a method to motivate. I will try to find a better motivation-giving method than the green point by proceeding with the project later. 

    - <a name-"fb-three"></a>[3] Intention of the brand description in Persona

        As we set our target user as Newcomers of 'eco-friendly' product consumption, we wanted to explain that he is not a complete "online shopping" new comer by describing the online or shopping application he usually uses.

- Modification of storyboards
  
    - <a name-"fb-four"></a>[4] We combine text on the storyboard and modify the contents of the storyboard to have scenario-driven content.
