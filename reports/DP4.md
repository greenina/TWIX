# DP4 : High-fidelity Prototyping



## POV

---

We re-stated our POV based on the feedback of DP3. While doing this, we tried not to ruin the values what we were inspired from by the interview results.

### POV

> **Newcomers of eco-friendly product consumption**

needs to

> **be supported in continuously receiving impetus about the environment without being discouraged by personal gain(price, functionality, etc)**

because

> **they lack of experience in considering eco-friendly factors when thinking about products in daily life**.
    
<br>
     

### Target Users

So our target users are **the newcomers of eco-friendly product consumption** who has ever been discouraged their green consumption by personal gain(price, functionality, etc).

We had define the word *newcomer* and *eco-friendly product* on our DP1 report. We also stated our needs and insights based on the interview results we conducted before, and we finally ended up with pretty decent POV through several revisions due to a few feedbacks. We tried to keep reminding our persona we wrote in DP2 and this POV in a progress of listing our tasks and making prototype which are following next parts.

<br><br>

## Tasks : List three core tasks your prototype supports

---

Then, we chose three core tasks our prototype supports for the users. We considered that each task could support the end-to-end scenario of the users.

**1. Put each one household of every room at home(living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) to wish list**

**2. Select an eco-friendly cushion you like and put in the wish list**

**3. Choose one non eco-friendly product in a wish list, and replace it with what companion likes**

    자세한 설명

///////Tasks align with the POV?

///////Tasks reflect target users's needs?

/////Three or more tasks?

///////Are the tasks distinct from each other?

//////Are the tasks described concretely and clearly?

/////User-level description not functionality description?


## Implementation Notes

***URL of our prototype***

https://twixigreen.herokuapp.com/

A live version of the prototype for evalation.
Note: the URL must work at least until your assignment is graded.
If it doesn't work, you'll be penalized.
If there are specific requirements (e.g., test user's ID/password, browser or device settings), include them as well.

***URL of our Git repository***

Make sure to add a README file that briefly describes the code, e.g., main JavaScript file, where main feature implementations are, etc.
Several lines are enough.

https://github.com/greenina/twixigreen.git

***Libraries and frameworks***

List any external dependencies you used for your implementation (e.g., React, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, etc.)

//////Libraries and frameworks used are listed?

//////Screenshots are added?

/////Screenshots capture representative moments of the prototype?

/////The prototype captures the three tasks?

/////The prototype is complete in that it supports an end-to-end scenario?

////The prototype follows good practices in visual design, layout, color, etc.?

## Individual Reflections

Each member should write this part on their own, reflecting on their own experience.
Merge all members' mini-reports in the final report. Answer the following questions:
Which part of the UI did you directly contribute to?
What were some of the difficulties you faced?
List one useful implementation skill you learned while working on this milestone.

### Google Slide we used

[[Team TWIX] DP 4: Hi-fi Prototyping 2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1neYmRYsWNs2xCzOmRgPsdWlMKxasMeA_b5JQ3xbhNT8/edit#slide=id.gdcb0c4819c_0_0)

### Peer reviews

**I like …**
[Arlandar/Mukhtar] that your app’s design is user-centered. Nice implementation.
[Colics/Minseo] I like that you changed your tasks to more meaningful ones. 
[pacific/han] cool animation when heart is clicked 200% satisfied with that cool thing
[HLK/Sewon Lim] Showing the product in the real living context is good.
[Colics/Sangwoo Park] Green-based overall color web
[Pacific/Choi]: The change of animation of polar bear was impressive and it would help user feel more satisfying.
[Pacific/Sehoon Lim]: Cute animation on companion

- Suggested solutions and specific reasons of HMWs and solutions
    - could be understood easily
    - how they touched user’s emotion by virtual companion
- Contents
    - persona description with brands info
    - the POV is related to eco-friendly products since they’re saving the nature
    - dividing environmental infos into several categories
    - detail and quality of storyboards

**I wish ...**

I wish …
[Pacific/Sehoon Lim]: There was more description. Green border doesn’t feel like ‘this is eco friendly'. it is true that green color shows eco friendly, but somehow it feels like green is for consistency not meaning echo. Showing selectable products in image of first page would be good, too.
[HLK/JaeHyun Kim] I wish there are more information about protecting animal, protecting nature..etc. And I also want to how it is done in this products. I think it should have standard since company may just say that they are doing all of these falsely for their sale.
[HLK/HanSookyung] items in the hovering pictures more visible
[[Pacific/Jaeryung Chung]I wish there were feature to search for the item. People usually don’t hover on the photo to search for what to buy. 
items in th
[pacific/han] checkbox was toggled when text are clicked
[HLK/Kangsan Kim] Using slide show? in the main page might not be efficient because users have to pass the card until they find what they want. 
[HLK/JaeHyun Kim] I wish that I can find the product easier. Because some products like tissue or lug are not only used in living room. It might be confused.
[Arlandar/Mukhtar] waving bear would be smaller since it distracts from focusing on products.
[Arlandar/Aidyn Aluadin] rating item could be implemented
[Arlandar/Aidyn Aluadin] Info about items could be more clear (i.e: “Production process”, “using product”, ‘after use” are not clear)
[Colics/Yoojin Hong] More information about eco-friendly products in detail below icons (Production Process, ..)

- Descriptions
    - explanation about why ‘to be steadily motivated in eco-friendly product consumption’ is the needs of the new-comers to eco-friendly products! Or was it the problem status? →[[1]](#fb-one)
- Wishes in a presentation
    - more explanation about the term you use in your presentation. I does not directly what it means getting interact emotionally and other terms.
    - reminder of HMW questions while introducing the solutions
    - indicator of which storyboard explain which solution
- Opinions about setting product's contribution
    - The effects of each product differ by amount, material, etc.

**What if ...**

[Colics/Sangwoo Park] Let user put the products that they want

**Others**

[Pacific/Jaeryung Chung] Where are the products information coming from?
[HLK/Han Sookyung] I couldn’t understand the polar bear at first, and it just seemed to block my view..
[Colics/Minseo] I wonder why there are also non eco friendly products(the ones that Bukkuk recommend other products) on your website.    
[Arlandar/Nurlykhan Kopenov] i like the idea, but where you will get 
eco-friendly products

- I’m curious why you chose those brands to explain persona! What did you intended for those information? → [[3]](#fb-three)
- Is the green points you mentioned in 3rd story board will be enough motivation? Maybe appealing that they use eco-friendly products may be good to advertise their cafe. → [[2]](#fb-two)
- I’m wondering how to evaluate environmental contribution
- I wonder what does 'interacting emotionally with eco-friendly products' means in HMW.
- I wonder if giving points on buying eco friendly products will cause overconsumption, which is bad for the environment. → [[2]](#fb-two)
- How will the green points divided when users purchase in group? → [[2]](#fb-two)

### Feedback during Session Time

- Extra explanation regarding needs → [[1]](#fb-one)
- Storyboard should not be UI-driven but scenario-driven → [[4]](#fb-four)
- Not like in the PPT, the storyboard and description should exist together, not separate → [[4]](#fb-four)

### Summarize the reflection of feedback

- Provision of more descriptions
    - <a name="fb-one"></a>[1] Extra explanation of needs :

        Our target users have the will to protect the environment, but they sometimes find their desire of personal gain(price, functionality, etc) suppressing their desire of contributing to environment, and eventually fail to purchase eco-friendly product.
        Therefore, users want to get motivated steadily in eco-friendly consumption for the desire of contributing to environment to overcome the desire of personal gain.
        We actually got this point not by our own assumption, but by the mentioning of our interviewee.

    - <a name="fb-two"></a>[2] About green points

        For reasons such as the UI of the program and its exact function are not clearly determined, we inserted the concept of a green point on the third storyboard. This is expressed as an example of a method to motivate. I will try to find a better motivation-giving method than the green point by proceeding with the project later. 

    - <a name="fb-three"></a>[3] Intention of the brand description in Persona

        As we set our target user as Newcomers of 'eco-friendly' product consumption, we wanted to explain that he is not a complete "online shopping" new comer by describing the online or shopping application he usually uses.

- Modification of storyboards
  
    - <a name="fb-four"></a>[4] We combined text on the storyboard and modified the storyboard of the solution 1 "Visually show how environment changes when purchasing each product", to make it user - and scenario- driven, not solution-driven
