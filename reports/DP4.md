# DP4 : High-fidelity Prototyping



## POV

---

We re-stated our POV based on the feedback of DP3. While doing this, we tried not to ruin the values what we were inspired from by the interview results.

### POV

> **Newcomers of eco-friendly product consumption**

needs to

> **be supported in continuously receiving impetus about the environment without being discouraged by personal gain(price, functionality, etc)**

because

> **they lack of experience in considering eco-friendly factors when thinking about products in daily life**.
    
<br>
     

### Target Users

> So our target users are **the newcomers of eco-friendly product consumption** who have ever been discouraged their green consumption by personal gain(price, functionality, etc).

We had define the word *newcomer* and *eco-friendly product* on our DP1 report. We also stated our needs and insights based on the interview results we conducted before, and we finally ended up with pretty decent POV through several revisions due to a few feedbacks. We tried to keep reminding our persona we wrote in DP2 and this POV in a progress of listing our tasks and making prototype which are following next parts.

<br><br>

## Tasks : List three core tasks your prototype supports

---

Then, we chose three core tasks our prototype supports for the users. We considered that three tasks could support the end-to-end scenario of the users. Also, we tried to reflect the points that the users hesitate green consuming. We'll explain more in each task.

<br>

**1. Put each one household of every room at home(living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) to wish list**

We just searched for a few reports of green consumption to concentrate on the core problem and to find out what the users really hesitate about the green consumption. While reading them, we found out that the consumer knowledge is one of the most important motivation on buying eco-friednly products<sup>[[1]](#footnote_1)</sup>. We kept considering about the form of mainpage between the page of online shopping mall style and the page with companion, but each one had its own painpoint. So we came out with a new idea based on the reasearch, which is to make the users to realize that there are a lot of eco-friendly products in daily life.

Through this task, the users realize the existence of various kinds of green products in daily life. We expect this progress can keep users from hesitated consumption of the users which caused by not knowing eco-friendly products. Also, by knowing these informations, they could have more chances to think about eco-friendly factors in real daily life.

<br>
    
**2. Select an eco-friendly cushion you like and put in the wish list**

기존의 유저들이 hesitate한 부분을 가장 직접적으로 해결했다고 볼 수 있다. 이 일련의 과정에서 쿠션을 찾는 과정에서, eco-friendly한 factor들을 접할 수 있는 기회를 많이 만든다.

일단 카테고리 페이지에서 여러 환경친화적인 기준으로 필터링해서 볼 수 있다. 자신이 생각하는 가장 중요한 환경친화적인 요소를 가지고 있는 제품을 살 수 있도록 한다. 자신이 좋아하는 쿠션을 고르는 과정에서 각 제품끼리의 비교가 필수적인데, 이 과정에 대한 베리어를 낮추어 사용자들이 좀 더 쉽게 비교 분석하여 결정할 수 있도록 한다. 비친환경 제품의 경우에는 친환경 제품과 여러 feature들을 비교하고, 친환경 제품을 클릭할 경우 같은 카테고리의 친환경 제품들을 비교하도록 한다. 그래서 그 유저가 hesitate한 점들 중, 각 제품에 대한 비교가 어렵다는 점을 해결하였다.
    
<br>

**3. Choose one non eco-friendly product in a wish list, and replace it with what companion likes**

정보를 아는 것과 지구를 지키고 싶다는 마음이 가장 큰 모티베이션이긴 하나, 이를 지속적으로 이끌어 줄 기능이 필요하다. 이에 대한 해결책으로 유저들이 감정적으로 교류할 수 잇는 companion을 만들자고 생각을 했다. 

유저의 입장에서, 자신의 구매로 인해 companion의 상태가 안좋아지는 결과를 알고 있음에도 그 행동(구입)을 그대로 실행하기란 쉽지 않다. 우리는 이 점을 파고 들었다. 마이페이지의 위시리스트를 보면 일반적인 유저의 경우 친환경적인 제품과 아닌 제품들이 모두 들어 있을 것이다. 친환경 제품의 경우 좋아하고, 아닌 제품의 경우 같은 역할을 하는 더 친환경적인 제품을 보여줌으로써 친환경적인 소비를 할 수 있도록 유도함과 동시에, 이코프렌들리한 facto에 대해 한번 더 생각해보도록 할 수 잇따. 또한 유저는 환경에 대해 한번 더 생각해볼 수 있는 기회를 받음으로써 계속해서 이러한 측면을 생각하고 고려할 수 있도록 도와준다.

A live version of the prototype for evalation.
Note: the URL must work at least until your assignment is graded.
If it doesn't work, you'll be penalized.
If there are specific requirements (e.g., test user's ID/password, browser or device settings), include them as well.

***URL of our Git repository***

Make sure to add a README file that briefly describes the code, e.g., main JavaScript file, where main feature implementations are, etc.
Several lines are enough.

### Peer reviews

**I like …**
[Arlandar/Mukhtar] that your app’s design is user-centered. Nice implementation.
[Colics/Minseo] I like that you changed your tasks to more meaningful ones. 
[pacific/han] cool animation when heart is clicked 200% satisfied with that cool thing
[HLK/Sewon Lim] Showing the product in the real living context is good.
[Colics/Sangwoo Park] Green-based overall color web
[Pacific/Choi]: The change of animation of polar bear was impressive and it would help user feel more satisfying.
[Pacific/Sehoon Lim]: Cute animation on companion

- Suggested solutions and specific reasons of HMWs and solutions
    - could be understood easily
    - how they touched user’s emotion by virtual companion
- Contents
    - persona description with brands info
    - the POV is related to eco-friendly products since they’re saving the nature
    - dividing environmental infos into several categories
    - detail and quality of storyboards

**I wish ...**

I wish …
[Pacific/Sehoon Lim]: There was more description. Green border doesn’t feel like ‘this is eco friendly'. it is true that green color shows eco friendly, but somehow it feels like green is for consistency not meaning echo. Showing selectable products in image of first page would be good, too.
[HLK/JaeHyun Kim] I wish there are more information about protecting animal, protecting nature..etc. And I also want to how it is done in this products. I think it should have standard since company may just say that they are doing all of these falsely for their sale.
[HLK/HanSookyung] items in the hovering pictures more visible
[[Pacific/Jaeryung Chung]I wish there were feature to search for the item. People usually don’t hover on the photo to search for what to buy. 
items in th
[pacific/han] checkbox was toggled when text are clicked
[HLK/Kangsan Kim] Using slide show? in the main page might not be efficient because users have to pass the card until they find what they want. 
[HLK/JaeHyun Kim] I wish that I can find the product easier. Because some products like tissue or lug are not only used in living room. It might be confused.
[Arlandar/Mukhtar] waving bear would be smaller since it distracts from focusing on products.
[Arlandar/Aidyn Aluadin] rating item could be implemented
[Arlandar/Aidyn Aluadin] Info about items could be more clear (i.e: “Production process”, “using product”, ‘after use” are not clear)
[Colics/Yoojin Hong] More information about eco-friendly products in detail below icons (Production Process, ..)

- Descriptions
    - explanation about why ‘to be steadily motivated in eco-friendly product consumption’ is the needs of the new-comers to eco-friendly products! Or was it the problem status? →[[1]](#fb-one)
- Wishes in a presentation
    - more explanation about the term you use in your presentation. I does not directly what it means getting interact emotionally and other terms.
    - reminder of HMW questions while introducing the solutions
    - indicator of which storyboard explain which solution
- Opinions about setting product's contribution
    - The effects of each product differ by amount, material, etc.

**What if ...**

[Colics/Sangwoo Park] Let user put the products that they want

**Others**

[Pacific/Jaeryung Chung] Where are the products information coming from?
[HLK/Han Sookyung] I couldn’t understand the polar bear at first, and it just seemed to block my view..
[Colics/Minseo] I wonder why there are also non eco friendly products(the ones that Bukkuk recommend other products) on your website.    
[Arlandar/Nurlykhan Kopenov] i like the idea, but where you will get 
eco-friendly products

- I’m curious why you chose those brands to explain persona! What did you intended for those information? → [[3]](#fb-three)
- Is the green points you mentioned in 3rd story board will be enough motivation? Maybe appealing that they use eco-friendly products may be good to advertise their cafe. → [[2]](#fb-two)
- I’m wondering how to evaluate environmental contribution
- I wonder what does 'interacting emotionally with eco-friendly products' means in HMW.
- I wonder if giving points on buying eco friendly products will cause overconsumption, which is bad for the environment. → [[2]](#fb-two)
- How will the green points divided when users purchase in group? → [[2]](#fb-two)

### Feedback during Session Time

- Extra explanation regarding needs → [[1]](#fb-one)
- Storyboard should not be UI-driven but scenario-driven → [[4]](#fb-four)
- Not like in the PPT, the storyboard and description should exist together, not separate → [[4]](#fb-four)

### Summarize the reflection of feedback

- Provision of more descriptions
    - <a name="fb-one"></a>[1] Extra explanation of needs :

        Our target users have the will to protect the environment, but they sometimes find their desire of personal gain(price, functionality, etc) suppressing their desire of contributing to environment, and eventually fail to purchase eco-friendly product.
        Therefore, users want to get motivated steadily in eco-friendly consumption for the desire of contributing to environment to overcome the desire of personal gain.
        We actually got this point not by our own assumption, but by the mentioning of our interviewee.

    - <a name="fb-two"></a>[2] About green points

        For reasons such as the UI of the program and its exact function are not clearly determined, we inserted the concept of a green point on the third storyboard. This is expressed as an example of a method to motivate. I will try to find a better motivation-giving method than the green point by proceeding with the project later. 

    - <a name="fb-three"></a>[3] Intention of the brand description in Persona

        As we set our target user as Newcomers of 'eco-friendly' product consumption, we wanted to explain that he is not a complete "online shopping" new comer by describing the online or shopping application he usually uses.

- Modification of storyboards
  
    - <a name="fb-four"></a>[4] We combined text on the storyboard and modified the storyboard of the solution 1 "Visually show how environment changes when purchasing each product", to make it user - and scenario- driven, not solution-driven
