------



## 1. Written Protocol



### 1. Instructions for preparation and setting up the testing environment

- URL: https://igreen-twix.web.app/

- Browser: Chrome(Recommended)

- Device: PC(Laptop, Desktop)

- Additional Data: Prepare some fake personal data you want to set as your email account and password (e.g. email: aa@aa.com, password: 123123)

  

### 2. Introduction and informed consent

> Hello. Thank you for participating in the interview of Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction course of KAIST School of Computing.
> We are Team TWIX and you are working with our usability testing, the 5th process of the design project. During this session, you will use the web service we have created through the previous design project process.
>
> Your screen will be screen recorded during this progress. The interview after the testing also will be voice recorded. The recorded data is later used to analyze problems in the process of using the service. Do you agree to screen recording and interview recording?
>
> Yes, thank you. Before starting the full-scale testing, you need to login to use the web service. This step is just taken in order to prevent data from overlapping in the DB when multiple people are testing simultaneously. As it is not related to the core test of our prototype, I would like to inform you that it is not a completely working function as used in normal websites. But for now, we ask you to login so that you can experience the proper test flow.
> Since you are using this website for the first time, you may need to sign up. Please create an account by entering a valid email address (including @) and a password of at least 6 characters. You can write down how you want to name your companion, in the “Companion name”, who will become your friend throughout your eco-friendly journey using this web service.
>
> Then, please log in using the email and password you just entered. Now let's start testing. During the testing process, you will have to clear three main tasks we offer you. I would appreciate it if you could think that you are actually purchasing the product and immerse yourself more like a real situation. Just follow our guide, and if there is something you don't know or want to say, feel free to tell us!



### 3. Task list & instruction

#### 1) Put each one household in every room at home(living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) to a wish list.

- As a first step towards green consumption, you may be at a loss where to begin. On the main page, you can see the rooms that exist in the regular home you are staying in. Each room has a number of household items that we use quite often, so choose one household item for each room and put the products into the wishlist from that category.

- If there is a product that you have used often from the product list, please select that product.

#### 2) Select an eco-friendly cushion you like and put in the wish list.

 - Cushion is placed on the sofa in the living room on our website. Since cushions in the actual product list aren't all the same, your mission is to buy the most eco-friendly cushion, depending on your judgement.

 - To help your judging process, the web service would give you some various clues, indicating a certain product is eco-friendly or not in a certain aspect. Based on these clues, think about which cushion is the greenest, and put your favorite cushion on your wishlist.

#### 3) Choose one non eco-friendly product in a wish list, and replace it with what your companion may like. ####

 - Your wish list may include products that are not eco-friendly. The polar bear character, your companion on the eco-friendly consumption journey, probably doesn’t like this non-green product.

 - Focusing on the clues your companion character offers, find out if there are any non eco-friendly products on your wish list, and look for other eco-friendly substitutes in the same category.



### 4. Recording strategy

> The testing will partially be recorded, and it will be used to analyze and observe how our service is used. It’ll be recorded via zoom, and you can feel free to turn off your camera. We only need the sound, and shared screen recording. 
>
> During the session, 
> Seungyeon Choi will verbally give you listed tasks (Facilitator),
> Inhwa Song will ask a few questions after the testing session (Interviewer),
> Gyewon Kim will observe how the service is used by writing down all user actions. (Observer), 
> Taeyang Yoon takes screenshots or partial screen recordings, while checking technical issues as well as if data is properly being collected in the database (Tech person). 
>
> After it’s recorded, we’ll capture some representative screenshots of the testing session, observe it and find some insights, and destroy it right away after use.



### 5. Questionnaires, Interview questions

1. Have you ever used a similar site, collecting information on eco-friendly consumption at a glance?

2. How did you realize about the change in polar bear status?(e.g. color, movement, below description, etc.)

3. Is there any kind of previous experiences you have that helped you to proceed the tasks easily while this usability testing?

4. Overall, was there any inconvenience you want to resolve or any function you feel necessary to be added.

5. Was there a function or part that you were confused about or didn't know the meaning? (with showing screenshots of each page for reminder)

6. Please tell me all the clues that represent the eco-friendly factors you found doing this web service testing.

   6-1. About the detected functions:

   - Do you think that those functions are designed as user-oriented enoughly and worked well with you?

    6-2. About the missed functions:

      - (After explaining the remaining features that the test user has not discovered, we ask if he/she have noticed the presence of the feature and if he/she think it has been implemented properly.)
      - e.g. Have you realized that each item in the product list has different eco-ratings according to how many green properties it meets, and these different eco-ratings are represented by borders of different saturation when your mouse is over a certain item?
        → Do you think this way of describing the degree of eco-friendly is appropriate?

7. Do you have any tips for other users who will be using this service in the future?

8. (Afterwards, ask questions according to the observation points we found during the testing process.)



### 6. Debrief prompt

> We really appreciate you participating in the usability test of our prototype. 
> So our project is for people who are the newcomers of green consumption, and our aid is to support in continuously receiving impetus about the environment
> without being discouraged by their personal gain(price, functionality, etc). In the overall flow you have just experienced, we tried to add eco-friendly elements such as the introduction of the concept of companion character. The data you provided will be reflected for developing and redesigning our project.
> Once again, thank you very much for participating in our usability test and interview.

| <center>Demographic of P1</center> | ***Age*** \|  35 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Male<br />***Feature*** \|  Office Worker<br />***Why is he a representative target user*** \|<br />He is similar to our persona because he usually uses a lot of product purchasing sites like Coupang. However, he said that he rarely considered eco-friendly factors when purchasing goods online, so even if he encountered eco-friendly products, he did not buy them because he could not understand the detailed information of that product.<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />As a whole, most of the features were well understood and used, accepting that they were similar to normal shopping mall sites. However, he totally failed to recognize that the state of polar bear is keep changing. He also confused when he met other items appear even though he only pressed the cushion on the mainpage. |

| <center>Demographic of P2</center> | ***Age*** \|  20 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Male<br />***Feature*** \|  Student<br />***Why is he a representative target user*** \|<br />He is one of our target users, who we conducted observation on DP1. Since he participated in our observation on DP1, he expressed his interest in our project continuously. He said "*It'd be great to see if the data from my interview helped you to improve your project. Also, I'm curious about how the solutions driven by my problem had implemented in the service."* So we thought we can check more directly if the hesitated points are whether solve or not through the observation/user testing of him.<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />Since he knows the context how we developed our service, he followed well and found almost every elements we embedded. However, what he had a few conflicts was mostly in using main page which means the main page has crucial problem in learnability (e.g. not knowing how to go to next room, getting confused what to click, and feeling curious why the page redirect to living category page with other products even he clicked tissue, etc.) |

| <center>Demographic of P3</center> | ***Age*** \|  25 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Female<br />***Feature*** \|  Cafe Vlog Youtuber<br />***Why is he a representative target user*** \|<br />After working at a cafe for a long time and experiencing a lot of disposable products, she became to have a habit of using tumblers. However, for other eco-friendly consumption, she has never tried it because she thought the barriers to entry were high, and she already has some pride that using tumblers alone seems to be sufficiently and enoughly helpful to the environment.<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />She seems to be really happy about the visual interface such as the dancing polar bear with speech bubbles when hovering the mouse. After she relized the condition when the polar bear's status will change, she kept focused on the polar bear and observed it by putting in and canceling various products. She was embrassed with the feedback that is given when pressing the share button for copying url in the form of alert, as she thought it was a defect of the website itself that she just occured a bug. |

| <center>Demographic of P4</center> | ***Age*** \|  25 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Male<br />***Feature*** \|  Part-time job in a personal cafe<br />***Why is he a representative target user*** \|<br />He is absolutely a newcomer of eco friendly product, and currently got interested in green consuming, influenced by an public advertisement related to protecting the environment. Since he was interested in some websites selling eco-friendly products, he could compare our website igreen with ones he've used so far(even though our website's purpose is different with those).<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />Since he was quite a motivated person even among newcomers, he really tried to avoid putting all non-eco-friendly products(which border was black) in the wish list. Also, it was out of our expectation that relationship of experience of green consumption and requirement in environmental related info of products would be proportional. He would like to get more info of each products, even though he was a real newcomer of eco-friendly consumption, |

* All the participants are our friends or acquaintance of our friends. All four participants were recently introduced to eco-friendly consumption on their own particular route, but the depth of all was still shallow.

## 3. Usability lessons

**Severity scale** Evaluated in three aspects, frequency, impact, and persistence, each ranged among High, Medium, Low

#### [Task 1] Put each one household in every room at home(living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) to a wish list.	

- *[Medium]* Didn't catch how to move to other rooms. (P1, P3)

  → Plan to address: Normally, the circles underneath the images are used to indicate where I am now, and in our case this was used as a button to change the image. Also the circles were in a position that could be seen by scrolling down, making it more difficult for users to access. Therefore, we want to show more explicitly that the image can be moved over by adding arrow buttons on the left and right side of the image, to positions that can be seen immediately when the page is loaded.

- *[High]* Be confused that he just pressed a particular item in the photo, but other items also displayed together after moving to the category page. (P1, P2, P3, P4)

  → Plan to address: A subcategory function is created to show specific product subcategories, for example, within the living room so that only tissues can be collected and viewed, when the user clicked the tissue on the Mainpage.

- *[Medium]* She doesn't know which category she's in on the category page, after clicking a certain item in the main page. (P3)

  → Plan to address: Creating a subcategory feature, it also shows the route through which the user enters the page.

- *[Low]* On the main page, because some products can't be clicked, it was hard to distinguish which one is clickable. (P1, P2, P4)

  → Plan to address: Originally, there were products that seemed clickable to create a function that providing relevant environmental information/news. However, since we have decided not to implement this feature, we plan to make these products look like backgrounds and make clickable products stand out more by adding borders.

#### [Task 2] Select an eco-friendly cushion you like and put in the wish list.

- *[Low]* He was unaware that the 'In a glance' button existed. (P1, P2)

  → Plan to address: Originally, the 'In a glance' button was in the very last corner of the filtering options on the category page. However, technically, the role of these filtering options and the button was different, so we decided to place in each different row and explicitly indicate why the users might need this feature.

- *[High]* She was uncomfortable with not being able to tap hearts on the category page. (P1, P2, P3, P4)

  → Plan to address: We are planning to add clicklisters to the heart buttons of the product boxes on the category page and implement them to be syncronized with the DB to enable addition/deletion to the wishlist.

- *[Medium]* She thinks it's an error when she hits the share button, being showed an alert window. (P3)

  → Plan to address: Instead of an alert window, we decied to replace it with a modal window with an mood that is visually similar to other elements on our website.

- [High] Users did not notice the fact that polar bears' fur color, ice size, and condition were changing much more than we expected. (P2, P3)

  → Plan to address: In the product detail page, the polar bear conveys their status more directly through speech balloons.

#### [Task 3] Choose one non eco-friendly product in a wish list, and replace it with what your companion may like.

- *[Low]* He felt that it takes too long for the recommended product to pop up after hovering over the non-friendly product photo on my page. (P2)

  → Plan to address: The delay was made intentionally to allow users to recognize why the recommended product was emerging, because if the delay time was reduced, the elements on the screen could be changed even before the user could recognize which product the user had hovering over. So we concluded not to change this delaying time.

- *[High]* Didn't understand what eco-score on my page meant. (P1, P3)

  → Plan to address: Originally, as the eco-score changed from 0 to 3, the state of polar bears was set to change to one of the four cases. It was easy for all users to understand what the polar bear status meant, but they found it difficult to understand exactly what the score meant. So we decided to just write down a description of the polar bear status, excepting eco-score.

- *[Low]* Doubtful about not disappearing immediately when he cancels a heart from the wishlist. (P2)

  → Plan to address: If a user accidentally clicks a heart, it is set not to be deleted immediately, reducing the risk of deleting it from the wishlist. Asking if you want to delete it through a modal window can cause unnecessary and bothersome mouse movements, so users can just turn the heart off and on. Comparing this risk reduction effect with the resolving question of why the product is not deleted immediately, we decided to choose the former, keeping the current implementation choice.

#### **[High-level Reflections]**

- What did you overall learn from the user testing experience?

  - We found it difficult for users to find all the eco-friendly keywords/hints we provided and understand the meaning immediately as well as we thought. It was necessary to provide a direct explanation for some factors that users thought would interpret the meaning while using the website currently without explanation.
  - We find that users may feel confused during use if we do not match the common contexts or features that users have learned while using other websites, such that it is also able to click hearts in the entire product list, or if the user takes the wrong action that causes an error, making the users encounter an alert window.

- What would you do differently for better results and insights?

  - In the unfriendly parts that we firstly thought would be understandable in context, for features that have been difficult to understand for many users, we have to provide sufficient explanation and induction. For instance, we have to improve to show more efficiently that the status of polar bears varies with user action, the main page shows different types of rooms that can be moved to different rooms, and so on.
  - Even if we implemented a new feature, in terms of its usage and user experience, we will have to match the context of ours with their other experiences they have gained from using other websites so far. For example, such as the feature that allow hearts to be turned off and on at the category page, which could not be completed before testing because of implementation issues, must be completed for better usability.

## 4. Studio Reflections

#### About the written Protocol

- I like the large amount of questionnaires and interview questions

- What if there were more various levels of asking semantic satisfaction in user interview?

  → Accepting this feedback, when we asked about what elements you could get green information from, we decided to ask users in more detail how well they thought the feature was implemented, why they didn't find it if they failed to caputre,  how they wanted it to develop, and so on.

#### About the usability of our prototype

- On My Page, the product boxes on the wish list looked exactly like the boxes on the category page, so I could see that when I clicked it, I can go the deatiled page for that product. However, in the case of the recommended products that pops up when I hover my mouse on, it looked completely different and didn't have even a heart button, so I didn't think it is clickable.

  → First of all, we decided to add a heart icon for recommended products. In addition, other clickable elements provided visual feedback that translucent when hovering the mouse but for this case it doesn't. In other words, it further reduced usability due to the lack of that feature. Therefore, we decided to provide visual feedback on how the product box looks translucent when hovering over the image of recommended products.

- It was harder than I thought to compare whether the product was eco-friendly or to what extent it was eco-friendly. There were so many contents written in the table below in the detailed page that it was a bit troublesome to read one by one, but instead, I just judged based on only three icons marked by the process(Production, Usage, Afterward) above.

  → During the overall testing process, we thought that users would not try to read specific information with the attitude of *"checking whether the features of a prototype made by a friend work correctly"* rather than *"finding information that would actually help me to buy a product.*" Therefore, we decided to recommend participating in the testing by immersing themselves in the situation with the idea of actually purchasing goods through revising the written protocol.

- I felt that it was hard to distinguish a clickable items from the main page.

  → As mentioned earlier in the Usability Lesson, we plan to make clickable products stand out more by adding borders.

- Because I moved my mouse in a hurry, I was not aware of tooltips(speech balloons showing when mouse hovering).

  → As mentioned earlier in the Usability Lesson, as for the problem that the users were not well aware of the change in polar bear's condition, we decided to show their status or important messages directly through speech balloons on the product details page.

## 5. Plan for iteration

1. #### Combining user testing results and studio reflection, we were able to organize the problems that we are going to improve as follows.

- ##### Not sufficiently consider the usability of the user point

  - Heart icons on the category page are not clickable.

    → In both the Category Page and the list of recommended products on My Page, make the heart icon can be clicked to add/delete to the wish list.

  - Heart icons of the recommended products shown on My Pageare not clickable without entering the product details page.

    → In both the Category Page and the list of recommended products on My Page, make the heart icon can be clicked to add/delete to the wish list.

  - There is a shortage of indicators on the category page to see which category I am currently looking at.

    → Subcategory features can be added to address this problem by telling users which path they have accessed the current page through.

  - There is just no way to to move to another room rather than the radio button in the main page .

    → Add arrows to images on Main Page to show that you can move on to other images, as well as use the arrows as buttons.

  - It is necessary to show what role each of the icons on the detail page (putting goods in the wishlist, sharing url, and going to the sales site) plays.

    → When hovering over each icon, text tells the users what each icon means, such as *wish*, *share*, *buy*.

- ##### Can't have enough support to hesitating moments for the newcomers of eco-friendly consumption

  - When the user go from the main page to the category page, even though he/she only clicked the tissue, other products are displayed together. Furthermore, the tissue can be found in any room in real world, we only placed it at the living room in our website.

    → Add a subcategory function to automatically filter, for example, the tissue products so that if the user clicks the tissue in the living room, it will go to the category page corresponding to the living room but can see only tissues there.

  - The main page should allow the users to consider green elements daily without that much effort, but it doesn't tell them enough about which products are available for green consumption.

    → More explicitly shows which clickable items exist for eco-friendly products in the Main Page.

  - The users are not well aware of the changing state of the companion character, polar bear.

    → Polar bears communicate their condition more directly through speech balloons.

2. #### Then, each function above was classified as how long it would take to be actually implemented (something that could be done quickly vs. something that would take a long time to change).

3. #### We decided to revise the part by dividing the roles as below.

   * At this time, we considered how long each function takes to implement, how similar each function is in the code, and where each person took the initiative in creating the prototype and wrote the code at the first phase.
   * For now, we divided our roles for efficiency, but decided to inform each other and collaborate if any problems arise during the actual implementation.

- **Gyewon Kim**
  - Enable heart click on category page
  - Enable heart click on product recommendation list in my page
- **Inhwa Song** 
  - Adding a speech balloon to a polar bear on the detail page
  - Show text when hovering icons on detail pages (wish, share, buy)
- **Taeyang Yoon**
  - Modify the product shown on the main page (more noticeable representation of the clickable product)
  - Adding an arrow button in the main page
- **Seungyeon Choi**
  - Implementing subcategory capabilities (path indicator texts, page routing)
