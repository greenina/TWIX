DP5: Usability Testing

------



## 1. Written Protocol



### 1. Instructions for preparation and setting up the testing environment

- URL: https://igreen-twix.web.app/

- Browser: Chrome(Recommended)

- Device: PC(Laptop, Desktop)

- Additional Data: Prepare some fake personal data you want to set as your email account and password (e.g. email: aa@aa.com, password: 123123)

  

### 2. Introduction and informed consent

> Hello. Thank you for participating in the interview of Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction course of KAIST School of Computing.
> We are Team TWIX and you are working with our usability testing, the 5th process of the design project. During this session, you will use the web service we have created through the previous design project process.
>
> Your screen will be screen recorded during this progress. The interview after the testing also will be voice recorded. The recorded data is later used to analyze problems in the process of using the service. Do you agree to screen recording and interview recording?
>
> Yes, thank you. Before starting the full-scale testing, you need to login to use the web service. This step is just taken in order to prevent data from overlapping in the DB when multiple people are testing simultaneously. As it is not related to the core test of our prototype, I would like to inform you that it is not a completely working function as used in normal websites. But for now, we ask you to login so that you can experience the proper test flow.
> Since you are using this website for the first time, you may need to sign up. Please create an account by entering a valid email address (including @) and a password of at least 6 characters. You can write down how you want to name your companion, in the “Companion name”, who will become your friend throughout your eco-friendly journey using this web service.
>
> Then, please log in using the email and password you just entered. Now let's start testing. During the testing process, you will have to clear three main tasks we offer you. Just follow our guide, and if there is something you don't know or want to say, feel free to tell us!



### 3. Task list & instruction

#### 1) Put each one household in every room at home(living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) to a wish list.

- On the main page, you can see the rooms that exist in the regular home you are staying in. Each room has a number of household items that we use quite often, so choose one household item for each room and buy products from that category.

- If there is a product that you have used often from the product list, please select that product.

#### 2) Select an eco-friendly cushion you like and put in the wish list.

 - Cushion is placed on the sofa in the living room on our website. Since cushions in the actual product list aren't all the same, your mission is to buy the most eco-friendly cushion, depending on your judgement.

 - To help your judging process, the web service would give you some various clues, indicating a certain product is eco-friendly or not in a certain aspect. Based on these clues, think about which cushion is the greenest, and put your favorite cushion on your wishlist.

#### 3) Choose one non eco-friendly product in a wish list, and replace it with what your companion may like. ####

 - Your wish list may include products that are not eco-friendly. The polar bear character, your companion on the eco-friendly consumption journey, probably doesn’t like this non-green product.

 - Focusing on the clues your companion character offers, find out if there are any non eco-friendly products on your wish list, and look for other eco-friendly substitutes in the same category.



### 4. Recording strategy

> The testing will partially be recorded, and it will be used to analyze and observe how our service is used. It’ll be recorded via zoom, and you can feel free to turn off your camera. We only need the sound, and shared screen recording. 
>
> During the session, 
> Seungyeon Choi will verbally give you listed tasks (Facilitator),
> Inhwa Song will ask a few questions after the testing session (Interviewer),
> Gyewon Kim will observe how the service is used by writing down all user actions. (Observer), 
> Taeyang Yoon takes screenshots or partial screen recordings, while checking technical issues as well as if datas is properly being collected in the database (Tech person). 
>
> After it’s recorded, we’ll capture some representative screenshots of the testing session, observe it and find some insights, and destroy it right away after use.



### 5. Questionnaires, Interview questions

1. Have you ever used a similar site, collecting information on eco-friendly consumption at a glance?

2. How did you realize about the change in polar bear status?(e.g. color, movement, below description, etc.)

3. Is there any kind of previous experiences you have that helped you to proceed the tasks easily while this usability testing?

4. Overall, was there any inconvenience you want to resolve or any function you feel necessary to be added.

5. Was there a function or part that you were confused about or didn't know the meaning? (with showing screenshots of each page for reminder)

6. Please tell me all the clues that represent the eco-friendly factors you found doing this web service testing.

   6-1. About the detected functions:

   - Do you think that those functions are designed as user-oriented enoughly and worked well with you?

    6-2. About the missed functions:

      - (After explaining the remaining features that the test user has not discovered, we ask if he/she have noticed the presence of the feature and if he/she think it has been implemented properly.)
      - e.g. Have you realized that each item in the product list has different eco-ratings according to how many green properties it meets, and these different eco-ratings are represented by borders of different saturation when your mouse is over a certain item?
        → Do you think this way of describing the degree of eco-friendly is appropriate?

7. Do you have any tips for other users who will be using this service in the future?

8. (Afterwards, ask questions according to the observation points we found during the testing process.)



### 6. Debrief prompt

> We really appreciate you participating in the usability test of our prototype. 
> So our project is for people who are the newcomers of green consumption, and our aid is to support in continuously receiving impetus about the environment
> without being discouraged by their personal gain(price, functionality, etc). In the overall flow you have just experienced, we tried to add eco-friendly elements such as the introduction of the concept of companion character. The data you provided will be reflected for developing and redesigning our project.
> Once again, thank you very much for participating in our usability test and interview.

| <center>Demographic of P1</center> | ***Age*** \|  35 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Male<br />***Feature*** \|  Office Worker<br />***Why is he a representative target user*** \|<br />He is similar to our persona because he usually uses a lot of product purchasing sites like Coupang. However, he said that he rarely considered eco-friendly factors when purchasing goods online, so even if he encountered eco-friendly products, he did not buy them because he could not understand the detailed information of that product.<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />As a whole, most of the features were well understood and used, accepting that they were similar to normal shopping mall sites. However, he totally failed to recognize that the state of polar bear is keep changing. He also confused when he met other items appear even though he only pressed the cushion on the mainpage. |

| <center>Demographic of P2</center> | ***Age*** \|  20 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Male<br />***Feature*** \|  Student<br />***Why is he a representative target user \|***<br />He is one of our target users, who we conducted observation on DP1. Since he participated in our observation on DP1, he expressed his interest in our project continuously. He said "*It'd be great to see if the data from my interview helped you to improve your project. Also, I'm curious about how the solutions driven by my problem had implemented in the service."* So we thought we can check more directly if the hesitated points are whether solve or not through the observation/user testing of him.<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />Since he knows the context how we developed our service, he followed well and found almost every elements we embedded. However, what he had a few conflicts was mostly in using main page which means the main page has crucial problem in learnability (e.g. not knowing how to go to next room, getting confused what to click, and feeling curious why the page redirect to living category page with other products even he clicked tissue, etc.) |

| <center>Demographic of P3</center> | ***Age*** \|  25 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Female<br />***Feature*** \|  Cafe Vlog Youtuber<br />***Why is she a representative target user \|***<br />After working at a cafe for a long time and experiencing a lot of disposable products, she became to have a habit of using tumblers. However, for other eco-friendly consumption, she has never tried it because she thought the barriers to entry were high, and she already has some pride that using tumblers alone seems to be sufficiently and enoughly helpful to the environment.<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />She seems to be really happy about the visual interface such as the dancing polar bear with speech bubbles when hovering the mouse. After she relized the condition when the polar bear's status will change, she kept focused on the polar bear and observed it by putting in and canceling various products. She was embrassed with the feedback that is given when pressing the share button for copying url in the form of alert, as she thought it was a defect of the website itself that she just occured a bug. |

| <center>Demographic of P4</center> | ***Age*** \|  25 yr old<br />***Gender*** \|  Male<br />***Feature*** \|  Part-time job in a personal cafe<br />***Why is he a representative target user \|***<br />He is absolutely a newcomer of eco friendly product, and currently got interested in green consuming, influenced by an public advertisement related to protecting the environment. Since he was interested in some websites selling eco-friendly products, he could compare our website igreen with ones he've used so far(even though our website's purpose is different with those).<br />***Summary description of session*** \|<br />Since he was quite a motivated person even among newcomers, he really tried to avoid putting all non-eco-friendly products(which border was black) in the wish list. Also, it was out of our expectation that relationship of experience of green consumption and requirement in environmental related info of products would be proportional. He would like to get more info of each products, even though he was a real newcomer of eco-friendly consumption, |

* All the participants are our friends or acquaintance of our friends. All four participants were recently introduced to eco-friendly consumption on their own particular route, but the depth of all was still shallow.

## 3. Usability lessons

**Severity scale** Evaluated in three aspects, frequency, impact, and persistence, each ranged among Cosmetic, Minor, Major, Catastrophic

#### [Task 1] Put each one household in every room at home(living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) to a wish list.	

-  *[Minor]* Didn't catch how to move to other rooms.
- *[Catastrophic]* Be confused that he just pressed a particular item in the photo, but other items also displayed together. 
- *[Major]* She doesn't know which category she's in on the category page, after clicking a certain item in the main page. 
- *[Cosmetic]* On the main page, because some products can't be clicked, it was hard to distinguish which one is clickable.


##### Reflections: 

#### [Task 2] Select an eco-friendly cushion you like and put in the wish list.

- *[Cosmetic]* He didn't notice that the category page showed how green each product was by the differenct colors of border.
- *[Minor]* He was unaware that the 'In a glance' button existed.
- *[Catastrophic]* She was also uncomfortable with not being able to tap hearts on the category page.
- *[Minor]* She thinks it's an error when she hits the share button, being showed an alert window.

##### Reflections: 

#### [Task 3] Choose one non eco-friendly product in a wish list, and replace it with what your companion may like.

- *[Cosmetic]* He felt that it takes too long for the recommended product to pop up after hovering over the non-friendly product photo on my page.
- *[Minor]* When hovering over pictures of non-environmental products on my page, she knew that the recommended products were displayed, but she didn't notice that the polar bear's comments above were changing.
- *[Major]* Didn't understand what eco-score on my page meant.
- *[Minor]* It takes a long time to understand what polar bears mean.
- *[Major]* It was difficult to distinguish between eco-friendly and non-eco-friendly products on the wish list.
- *[Cosmetic]* Doubtful about not disappearing immediately when he cancels a heart from the wishlist.
