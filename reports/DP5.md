DP5: Usability Testing

------



## 1. Experience



### 1. Instructions for preparation and setting up the testing environment

- URL: https://igreen-twix.web.app/

- Browser: Chrome(Recommended)

- Device: PC(Laptop, Desktop)

- Additional Data: Prepare some fake personal data you want to set as your email account and password (e.g. email: aa@aa.com, password: 123123)

  

### 2. Introduction and informed consent

> Hello. Thank you for participating in the interview of Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction course of KAIST School of Computing.
> We are Team TWIX and you are working with our usability testing, the 5th process of the design project. During this session, you will use the web service we have created through the previous design project process.
>
> Your screen will be screen recorded during this progress. The interview after the testing also will be voice recorded. The recorded data is later used to analyze problems in the process of using the service. Do you agree to screen recording and interview recording?
>
> Yes, thank you. Before starting the full-scale testing, you need to login to use the web service. This step is just taken in order to prevent data from overlapping in the DB when multiple people are testing simultaneously. As it is not related to the core test of our prototype, I would like to inform you that it is not a completely working function as used in normal websites. But for now, we ask you to login so that you can experience the proper test flow.
> Since you are using this website for the first time, you may need to sign up. Please create an account by entering a valid email address (including @) and a password of at least 6 characters. You can write down how you want to name your companion, in the “Companion name”, who will become your friend throughout your eco-friendly journey using this web service.
>
> Then, please log in using the email and password you just entered. Now let's start testing. During the testing process, you will have to clear three main tasks we offer you. Just follow our guide, and if there is something you don't know or want to say, feel free to tell us!



### 3. Task list & instruction

#### 1) Put each one household in every room at home(living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom) to a wish list.

- On the main page, you can see the rooms that exist in the regular home you are staying in. Each room has a number of household items that we use quite often, so choose one household item for each room and buy products from that category.

- If there is a product that you have used often from the product list, please select that product.

#### 2) Select an eco-friendly cushion you like and put in the wish list.

 - Cushion is placed on the sofa in the living room on our website. Since cushions in the actual product list aren't all the same, your mission is to buy the most eco-friendly cushion, depending on your judgement.

 - To help your judging process, the web service would give you some various clues, indicating a certain product is eco-friendly or not in a certain aspect. Based on these clues, think about which cushion is the greenest, and put your favorite cushion on your wishlist.

#### 3) Choose one non eco-friendly product in a wish list, and replace it with what your companion may like. ####

 - Your wish list may include products that are not eco-friendly. The polar bear character, your companion on the eco-friendly consumption journey, probably doesn’t like this non-green product.

 - Focusing on the clues your companion character offers, find out if there are any non eco-friendly products on your wish list, and look for other eco-friendly substitutes in the same category.



### 4. Recording strategy

> The testing will partially be recorded, and it will be used to analyze and observe how our service is used. It’ll be recorded via zoom, and you can feel free to turn off your camera. We only need the sound, and shared screen recording. 
>
> During the session, 
> Seungyeon Choi will verbally give you listed tasks (Facilitator),
> Inhwa Song will ask a few questions after the testing session (Interviewer),
> Gyewon Kim will observe how the service is used by writing down all user actions. (Observer), 
> Taeyang Yoon takes screenshots or partial screen recordings, while checking technical issues as well as if datas is properly being collected in the database (Tech person). 
>
> After it’s recorded, we’ll capture some representative screenshots of the testing session, observe it and find some insights, and destroy it right away after use.



### 5. Questionnaires, Interview questions

1. Have you ever used a similar site, collecting information on eco-friendly consumption at a glance?

2. How did you realize about the change in polar bear status?(e.g. color, movement, below description, etc.)

3. Is there any kind of previous experiences you have that helped you to proceed the tasks easily while this usability testing?

4. Overall, was there any inconvenience you want to resolve or any function you feel necessary to be added.

5. Was there a function or part that you were confused about or didn't know the meaning? (with showing screenshots of each page for reminder)

6. Please tell me all the clues that represent the eco-friendly factors you found doing this web service testing.
   6-1. About the detected functions:

   - Do you think that those functions are designed as user-oriented enoughly and worked well with you?

   6-2. About the missed functions:

      - (After explaining the remaining features that the test user has not discovered, we ask if he/she have noticed the presence of the feature and if he/she think it has been implemented properly.)
      - e.g. Have you realized that each item in the product list has different eco-ratings according to how many green properties it meets, and these different eco-ratings are represented by borders of different saturation when your mouse is over a certain item?
        - → Do you think this way of describing the degree of eco-friendly is appropriate?

7. Do you have any tips for other users who will be using this service in the future?

8. (Afterwards, ask questions according to the observation points we found during the testing process.)



### 6. Debrief prompt

> We really appreciate you participating in the usability test of our prototype. 
> So our project is for people who are the newcomers of green consumption, and our aid is to support in continuously receiving impetus about the environment
> without being discouraged by their personal gain(price, functionality, etc). In the overall flow you have just experienced, we tried to add eco-friendly elements such as the introduction of the concept of companion character. The data you provided will be reflected for developing and redesigning our project.
> Once again, thank you very much for participating in our usability test and interview.
