# DP1: Needfinding

 <a name="eco-friendly"></a>**:four_leaf_clover:We call it an eco-friendly product when "consumer's motivation" of the experience of buying product includes environment in any point of the whole product purchasing process.**



## 1. Experience

---

At first, we decide to redesign how a user who is interested in environment achieves green or sustainable life. However, we found out that its quite broad and also includes all of our team members, so we revised our target user and the experience we want to redesign as below:

<a name="experience"></a>Redesign how [**newcomers of eco-friendly product consumption**](#newcomers) achieves green life by **buying eco-friendly products**

:exclamation: TWIX team members are **not** included in the target user because 

:one: We came out with this target user because we were sure that we can be considered as quite an expert in eco-friendly product consumption(definitely not a newcomer)
- Inhwa, Taeyang, Seungyeon are roommates as well, and we "always" purchase best eco-friendly product for our public utiliy. 
- We four share used to share and talk about eco-friendly products and it's purchase very often. 

:two: Also, buy applying the survey we constructed before selecting interviewees to our teammates, none of our team members are included in the range of 'newcomer's
- <a name="newcomers"></a>newcomers of eco-friendly product consumption

    In advance to selecting interviewees, we ought to get an outline of the [standard](#standard) of our target user.[(eco-friendly product)](#eco-friendly)

    <a name="standard"></a>We say him/her a newcomer if the survey result is less than **50%**.

## 2. Observations & Interviews

---

### Before Interviews

As we wrote before, we conducted survey with several questions that can show a person's level of knowledge and interest with green life. Throughout 27 responses, we selected 5 interviewees who are interested in sustainable life but are newcomers in consumption of eco-friendly products.



### Conduct the Observations and Interviews

- General Questions for Interviewees
    - What was uncomfortable about this process? What point in the process do you think needs improvement?
    - Will you buy an eco-friendly product next time if you have to buy the same kind of product? Why?
    - Will you use the same method we used this time when you need to purchase eco-friendly products next time? Why?
    - Can you tell us about factors that you focus on looking for each product (e.g. Bottled water: plastic packaging)
        - Why did you focus on that element?
    - Is there any new facts or concepts that you learned through this search?
    - Comparing to this search, how much time do you used to spend for purchasing a product? Why?
    - Any thoughts on the price range? Why?

*REMINDER: our experience is buying eco-friendly products*

- **How each user is related to the Experience**

  **A(extreme user))** He had NO experience of purchasing eco-friendly products. In other words, he never had an opportunity to buy a product with a motivation of protecting the environment. However, he has a perception that it's likely to use an eco-friendly product and has an awareness of the environment. Moreover, he rarely used on-line shopping itself. So, we selected him as an extreme user who never have purchased eco-friendly product and also have extremely less experience in on-line shopping. 

  **B)** He had only one experience of purchasing eco-friendly products. His one experience of buying eco-friendly products was not intentionally searching for and choosing eco-friendly products, but rather because he searched for those kinds of products, and just there was a "green" titled. With little intentional experience in purchasing eco-friendly products, he had no information about how to purchase eco-friendly products.

  **C)** He had 1 times of buying eco-friendly products. He had known about few echo-friendly products like no-label water bottle through the news. He focused on unique features of the products like FSC mark when he chose products. In the interview after observation, he said he will take advice from a friend who have many eco-friendly consumption experiences. At the point that he doesn't have many experiences for eco-friendly consumptions, he is suitable for our target users, newcomers.

  **D)** He had 3 times of buying eco-friendly products. Also, there are a few family members who are interested in purchasing those things, so he had heard about companies or such products that are eco-friendly. However, since himself has rarely bought such products, he doesn't know what to do even he had some basis and also interests on sustainable life.

  **E)** Her perception that it's likely to buy an eco-friendly product is really high. And having a puppy was an opportunity for her to get interested in protecting the environment, especially opposing animal testing. She had more experiments of buying eco-friendly products than other interviewees, but it seemed obvious that she's a newcomer of eco-friendly consumption because she only had slight knowledge and experiment about her interest, and was ignorant about other parts of the eco-friendly product.



- **About Extreme User**

  - Extreme user we selected among interviewees is  'Interviewee A', who is extremely newcomer of eco-friendly shopping. He got 0/13 score on a pre-interview survey, also he doesn't have any eco-friendly shopping experience.

  - We also interviewed the user on the opposite side of extreme user, 'Interviewee F', who might be called as an 'expert'. We organized the text related to the expert on [the appendix](#appendix) at the bottom of this report.



### Interesting Moments

We found several common features of interviewees. In addition, based on interviews of our Extreme User(A) and Expert User(F),  we analyzed several contrasts between them, too.

- Lists of Common Features of Interviewees.
    - Interviewees have their individual criterias over purchasing eco-friendly products.
    - If they had background knowledge already, they tries to look up based on it without additional searching.
    - Use 'Eco-friendly' keyword for searching on Google.
    - Compare the prices of multiple products through Coupang or Naver shopping.
    - Spend lots of time for reading each product's ingredient instructions.
- Comparison between Extreme User and Expert
    - Information Acception
        - Extreme User: Accepts all the most information on the internet
        - Expert User: Selectively skip out sponsorship review based on experience
    - Average time for searching information
        - Extreme User: Tried to search multiple products at a time
        - Expert User: Used more time than extreme user to collect more information of products
    - Focus of choice
        - Extreme User: Focused on price
        - Expert User: Focused on balance between environment and efficacy of product





## 3. Needs

### Analyzing Progress

- Based on the analysis of the characteristics and motivations of the target users from observations and interviews, we were able to understand their needs.
- After inducing 10 needs, three of them could be selected and highlighted by voting for the most notable and interesting needs.
    - Bolded ones are the needs selected by the voting.

### List of Needs We Found

- Remarks

  **3)** *Eco-friendly products generally have higher prices than other products. People's perception of environment changed the amount of money they finally decided to buy, the result of comparing between the two trade-offs: how much greener the products are and how much more expensive they could pay.*

  **4)** *If there are sales sites recommended by acquaintances around them, they tended to believe in them without applying strict judgment criteria for other reliability.*

  **7)** *Thinking of being eco-friendly in the packaging or transportation process was a prominent feature that only interviewees with relatively high experience in purchasing eco-friendly products.*

  **10)** *All interviewees were skeptical at an exorbitant price, even if they had to consider eco-friendly factors.*

    |<center>10</center>| Product collection that fits my criteria                     | ***reflect the criteria of individual’s purchase***          |

- Remarks

  **3)** *It is better, if there should be, the advertisement can be more helpful that contains information, helping consumers scrutinize the certain product from the perspective of consumption, not helping the promotion from the perspective of seller.*

  **4)** *Providing a variety of styles that can increase accessibility and convenience for actual users to write reviews will also increase the likelihood for the quality of information that can be accessed from the buyer's perspective.*

### Summarize the reflection of feedback

- DP0 Feedback: more specific/detailed target user group and experience to redesign
    - We had [narrowed down our target user group and experience to redesign](#experience), and make sure that our team members are not included in target user group.
- Should provide clear standards to define terms that are used in project
    - <a name="fb-one"></a>**[1]** 'Newcomer' : We reflected this by analyzing the result of the survey, [applying more digitized criteria](#newcomers).
    - <a name="fb-two"></a>**[2]** 'Eco-friendly product' : We reflected this at the very [first of this report](#eco-friendly)!
        - <a name="fb-two-one"></a>**[2-1]** We had defined the term of 'eco-friendly product' as all the products whose "environment" element was included as consumer's consideration in any point of the product purchasing process.
- Make sure that all team members are excluded in the range of target users
    - <a name="fb-three"></a>**[3]** We forgot to put about this in the presentation, but we also conducted the survey! [The result](#not-in-target) is on the top of this report.
- Opinions about Selecting Target User
    - <a name="fb-four"></a>**[4]** Actually, we already decided the target users, and the procedure after interview was to set the range of target user more definitely.
    - <a name="fb-five"></a>**[5]** Users who have similar number of experiences  have different level of basis about green life and also vice versa, we think it's enough to bring our target user the same.
- About extreme user
    - <a name="fb-six"></a>**[6]** We wanted to interview an expert as the opposite case of extreme user. However, we agree with comments that it could be confused, so we just put the related explanation about expert in [the appendix](#appendix).
- Others
    - <a name="fb-seven"></a>**[7]** We never restricted the experience to online environment, but as covid-19 outbreak, users tend to use online shopping malls. We also ask some questions related to offline experience during interviews. So we want to make clear that we are open-minded to think about offline environment, too.

### About Interview of Expert

We wanted to interview with subjects who have domain expertise in the consumption of eco-friendly products

Actually, we added the interviewee F as the exactly opposite user of extreme user (interviewee A),  for taking some tips from her experience on eco-friendly consumption.

She's been doing environmental activities for a long time, also have lots of experiences in purchasing eco-friendly products.

She knew many sites like experienced person. When she started searching products of each categories, she always starting with those sites instead of Google. This was clear differences between her and other newcomer interviewees.

Also, she had several tips for select reviews which is not a commercial reviews. 

- Tips for selecting
  - If there are multiple brands listed, not just one brand, it would be more confidence.
  - Try to catch feedbacks of product's cons, not only good things.
  - Sometimes environmental articles introduce some products. Refer to them.
  - Compare many reviews  you can

She said that there are no site that collects information about eco-products from different companies, which causes inconvenience in purchasing eco-products. Naturally, she said she usually spends more time purchasing in her real life, also said she wanted the ability to reduce this inconvenience.
